# Environment Variables Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The iOS build was failing with the error:
```
./lib/scripts/ios-workflow/build.sh: line 77: UUID: unbound variable
```

## Root Cause

The build script was trying to use environment variables (`UUID`, `BUNDLE_ID`) that were set in the pre-build script but were not available in the build script context. This happens because:

1. Environment variables set in one script are not automatically available in another script
2. The build script was trying to use variables without checking if they exist
3. The variables were not being properly exported or passed between scripts

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Created Environment Variables Setup Script**
Created `lib/scripts/ios/setup_environment_variables.sh` that:
- Sets default values for required variables
- Extracts UUID and BUNDLE_ID from provisioning profile if not set
- Validates that required variables are present
- Exports variables for use in other scripts

### 2. **Updated Build Script**
Updated `lib/scripts/ios-workflow/build.sh` to:
- Call the environment variables setup script before building
- Handle missing environment variables gracefully
- Provide clear error messages if variables are missing

### 3. **Automatic Variable Extraction**
The script can automatically extract required variables from:
- Environment variables (if set)
- Provisioning profile (if available)
- Default values (for non-critical variables)

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/scripts/ios/setup_environment_variables.sh`** - Created environment variables setup script
2. **`lib/scripts/ios-workflow/build.sh`** - Updated to use environment variables setup

## Environment Variables Handled

### Required Variables
- **`UUID`** - Provisioning profile UUID
- **`BUNDLE_ID`** - App bundle identifier

### Optional Variables (with defaults)
- **`CM_DISTRIBUTION_TYPE`** - Default: "Apple Distribution"
- **`CODE_SIGNING_STYLE`** - Default: "manual"
- **`APPLE_TEAM_ID`** - Warning if not set

## Usage

### Manual Setup
```bash
./lib/scripts/ios/setup_environment_variables.sh
```

### Automatic Setup (in build workflow)
The environment variables are now automatically set up during the build process.

## Verification

The setup script verifies:
- ✅ UUID is set or can be extracted from provisioning profile
- ✅ BUNDLE_ID is set or can be extracted from provisioning profile
- ✅ Optional variables have sensible defaults
- ✅ All variables are exported for use in other scripts

## Error Handling

The script provides clear error messages:
- If UUID cannot be extracted: "UUID is not set and could not be extracted from provisioning profile"
- If BUNDLE_ID cannot be extracted: "BUNDLE_ID is not set and could not be extracted from provisioning profile"
- If APPLE_TEAM_ID is missing: Warning (non-critical)

## Prevention

The build script now includes this setup automatically, preventing environment variable issues in future builds.

## Result

The iOS build should now proceed without the "unbound variable" error. All required environment variables are properly set and validated before the build process begins.
